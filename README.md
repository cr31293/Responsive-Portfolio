# *Student Portfolio - BootStrap*
The following site was developed entirely through the BootStrap package with the intent to show control over the grid-system, formatting, design, and page navigation, all-the-while maintaining mobile-friendly functionality.

### *About*
Includes a brief bio showing use of:
* Navbar
* Jumbotron
* Cards
* Image / Text formating

### *Portfolio*
Through the use of a dropdown in the Navbar two options are linked:
* Web Portfolio
    * Github profile link through a 'font-awesome' image
    * Project area created to display finished/in-progress work
    ** nav tabs for each project to show:
    *** Project image
    *** Embedded readme markdown to describe project use
    *** Github link to project repository

### *Contact*
Contact form offering:
* Template to submit a message to me through the browser
    * Currently showcasing how to 'disable' forms as from what I understand knowledge of PHP is required to get the message form in a functional state.
* Use of iconography to offer 4 distinct avenues to contact:
    * Twitter
    * GitHub
    * Email
