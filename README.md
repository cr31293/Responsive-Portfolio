# *Student Portfolio - BootStrap*
The following site was developed entirely through the BootStrap package with the intent to show control over the grid-system, formatting, design, and page navigation, all-the-while maintaining mobile-friendly functionality.

### *About*
Includes a brief bio showing use of:
* Navbar
* Jumbotron
* Cards
* Image / Text formating

### *Portfolio*
Through the use of a dropdown in the Navbar two options are linked:
* Web Portfolio
    * Github profile link through a 'font-awesome' image
    * Area prepared to showcase/include front-end and back-end development work as we complete projects throughout the course. Placeholder images used for now to give structure,     but once applicable images will link to appropriate git repository for each project. 
* Twitch Content
    * functioning link to profile hidden in Twitch Logo
    * Grid formatting laid out with placeholders to show intended look of page
    * Twitch Clip embedding is a work in progress - we've at least established a connection with Twitch.tv but thus far unsuccessful in pulling back the relevent video
<!-- This was an attempt at going above assignment requirements. Goal was to successfully embed live streaming on this page, chat features, and saved clips,
    however the provided documention for embedding wasn't entirely clear to me, leaving me unsuccessful. -->

### *Contact*
Contact form offering:
* Template to submit a message to me through the browser
    * Currently showcasing how to 'disable' forms as from what I understand knowledge of PHP is required to get the message form in a functional state.
* Use of iconography to offer 4 distinct avenues to contact:
    * Twitter
    * GitHub
    * Email
    * Twitch
